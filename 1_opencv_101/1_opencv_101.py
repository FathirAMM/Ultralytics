### Basic operations with OpenCV
import cv2

# Operation-1: Read the image from directory
# image = cv2.imread("image.jpg")
# print("Image shape:", image.shape)  # Print the shape of the image


# Operation-2: Blur the image
# blurred = cv2.blur(image, (50, 50))


# Operation-3: Visualize the image
# cv2.imshow("test", blurred)
# cv2.waitKey(0)  # display until key press


# Operation-4: Write the image in directory
# cv2.imwrite("test.png", blurred)


# Operation-5: Crop the image and display it
# sliced_image = image[240:450, 680:900] # Crop the image from y=240 to y=450 and x=680 to x=900
# cv2.imshow("sliced_window", sliced_image)
# cv2.waitKey(0)


# Operation-6: Read and process video file
videocapture = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mov")
while videocapture.isOpened():
    success, frame = videocapture.read()
    if success:
        cv2.imshow("test", frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(2) & 0xFF == ord("q"):
            break
    else:
        break  # break the window once frames completed
